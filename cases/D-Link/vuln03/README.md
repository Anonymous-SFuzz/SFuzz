# D-Link DIR809 Vulnerability

The Vulnerability is in page `/fromLogin` which influences the latest version of this router OS. 

The firmware version is [DIR-809Ax_FW1.12WWB03_20190410](http://www.dlinktw.com.tw/techsupport/ProductInfo.aspx?m=DIR-809) 

## Progress

- Confirmed by vendor. 


## Vulnerability description

In the function `sub_8003183C` ( page `/fromLogin` ), we find a stack overflow vulnerability, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on system via a crafted post request. 

Here is the description,  

1. The `get_var` function extracts user input from the a http request. For example, the code below will extract the value of the key "curUid" in the http post request which is completely under the attacker's control. 
2. The string `v4` obtained from user is then passed to `sub_800FE9CC` as the third argument. 
3. In the function `sub_800FE9CC`, argument `a3` is copied onto the stack using `strcpy` without any check. So we can make the stack buffer overflow in `v8`. (See the second figure below. )
